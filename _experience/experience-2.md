I spent the summer of 2022 in Boulder, Colorado as a [SIParCS](https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/outreach/internships) intern working on the python package, Xarray. Most of this work focused on developing tutorials for using Xarray to work with cloud-optimized remote sensing data. I also assisted the Xarray tutorial at the [2022 SciPy Conference](https://www.scipy2022.scipy.org/), wrote material for the [Xarray tutorial](https://tutorial.xarray.dev/intro.html) and made contributions to the Xarray codebase. You can read more about my time as a SIParCS intern [here](https://xarray.dev/blog/siparcs-2022).
