------
During my time at [Earthmover](https://earthmover.io/), I worked on a range of projects including making contributions to the codebase and documentation of Arraylake, a scientific data platform for working with multidimensional array data in the cloud, and working on open-source projects such as [Xarray](https://xarray.dev/) and [Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). I also spent time developing workflows that use cloud-optimized raster and vector data to construct and use vector data cubes with [Xvec](https://xvec.readthedocs.io/en/stable/); this work was discussed in a [blog post](https://earthmover.io/blog/vector-datacube-pt1) and webinar.
